Ef is a software for simulation of charged particles dynamics. It's primary areas of application are accelerator science and plasma physics. Below are several examples of the simulations that can be done with this program:

Ef focuses on nonrelativistic energies.
Particular emphasis is placed on low-energy beams, such that can be found in ion sources and electron guns.
A motivation behind the program, the scope and the general goals are discussed [here](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/Motivation-and-Goals).

Particles dynamics is traced under action of external electromagnetic fields. 
Particle self-interaction is taken into account with [particle-in-cell](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/What-It-Is-and-How-It-Works#intuitive-introduction-to-particle-in-cell-method) method. Detailed description of the mathematical model can be found [here](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/What-It-Is-and-How-It-Works#mathematical-model-description).


Attention is given to integration with CAD software to allow for simulation of complex real-life experimental setups.
An experimental plugin for FreeCAD [exists](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/Freecad-and-Paraview). 


Ef is a free software -- it's source code is open and avaible for
modification and redistribution.
C++ (this one) and [Python](https://github.com/epicf/ef_python) versions are available.
While Python version is easy to install and experiment with, it is
reccomended to use C++ version for large-scale simulations.


[Current features](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/Current-Features-and-Development-Roadmap) 
are described in detail in appropriate wiki sections,
as well as [installation procedure](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/Installation). 
Some usage [examples](https://github.com/epicf/ef/wiki/Examples) are also given.


To use Ef on Hybrilyt system you must enable following modules:


1) boost/v1.59.0-2
2) openmpi/v2.1.2-2
3) gcc/v4.9.3-1
4) cuda/v10.0-1


Also you need to specialize new path to CUSP directory in Makefile 
rewriting this line:


CUSPFLAGS=-I/zfs/hybrilit.jinr.ru/user/and_so_on
